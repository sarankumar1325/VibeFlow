## 🚀 VibeFlow AI Documentation System - Core Features

### Auto-Generated Application Overview (Mental Model Generator)
**Feature:** A built-in tool that automatically scans the entire codebase and generates a detailed architectural overview using markdown and Mermaid diagrams.

**Implementation Details:**
- Classify information from the codebase into perspectives: Architectural, Developer, and Product Management.
- Export results to a README.md or architecture.md file.
- Allow periodic re-scanning to keep the document updated.
- Integrate with AI context windows for persistent use in AI conversations.

### Structured PRD Generation with AI
**Feature:** AI-assisted Product Requirements Document (PRD) creation tool that operates from a product manager's perspective before coding begins.

**Implementation Details:**
- Prompts users to describe the feature idea.
- Generates a markdown PRD including:
  - User stories
  - Functional requirements
  - Non-functional requirements (performance, accessibility, responsiveness)
  - Stakeholders/personas from the architecture document
- Saves the PRD to a /prds folder for future iterations and references.

### Implementation Progress Tracker
**Feature:** A system that automatically tracks implementation status against the PRD, updating the document with completed, in-progress, and pending features.

**Implementation Details:**
- Compares current code with PRD items using natural language and file diffing.
- Updates the PRD with an "Implementation Status" section.
- Lists:
  - What has been implemented
  - What remains
  - Next actionable steps
- Helps other devs or agents pick up where progress was left off. It also be change of logs of works that has been done
